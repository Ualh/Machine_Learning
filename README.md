# Precision Peaks: Enhancing Real Estate Forecasting in Switzerland with Tailored Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview
This project, part of a Master's degree course in Machine Learning at the University of Lausanne, aims to leverage advanced analytical approaches to predict real estate prices across Switzerland. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset scraped from ImmoScout24 and enriched with additional demographic, political, and tax data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, this study provides insightful analyses into real estate valuation. The primary goal is to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting property prices based on real-time market data.

## Key Features
- Data Integration: Combines extensive real estate data with demographic and tax information for a detailed market analysis.
Model Assessment: Employs both Linear Regression and Random Forest models to identify the best predictive approach.
- Advanced Techniques: Utilizes supervised and unsupervised learning to analyze complex relationships within the data.
- Tailored Approaches: Develops region-specific models for nuanced insights into the Swiss real estate market.
- Comprehensive Evaluation: Uses metrics like R-squared, RMSE, and MAE, complemented by cross-validation to ensure model accuracy.
- Installation
Before starting, ensure you have R and RStudio installed. Clone this repository and install the required packages.
