## Results

TODOS: 
Present All Results:

- Include both positive and negative results without further data or method descriptions.

Use Subsections:

- Structure the section with subsections for clarity, especially if there are many results.

Highlight Key Figures:

- Show the most interesting and relevant figures in the main results section.
Use Appendix for Additional Figures:

- Place additional figures (e.g., extensive time series) in the appendix or supplementary material and reference them appropriately.
Include Technical Interpretations:

- Provide limited technical interpretations of the results, saving broader discussions for the next section.

# Recommendations and Discussion

- Summary of what was observed from the results
- Implications for the business (link with the context and the initial objectives of the study).
- Limitations (this may be the subject of a separated section). An opening is often expected here: “What next?” “What can be done for improvement”, etc.?
