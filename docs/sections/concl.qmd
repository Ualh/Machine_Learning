# Conclusion

This project used data science and machine learning techniques to predict Swiss real estate prices, focusing on data scrapped from ImmoScout24. Through data analysis and model evaluation, several insights and conclusions were drawn:

## Linear Regression Model:
- Initially employed, the linear regression model provided moderate explanatory power with an R-squared of 0.493 and an RMSE of 980,302.
- Model refinement through stepwise regression slightly improved performance but still struggled with higher price points and multicollinearity issues.
- Simplifying the model by focusing on specific cantons and removing less significant variables improved stability and predictive power, though challenges remained with higher property prices.

## Random Forest Model:
- The Random Forest model addressed the limitations of linear regression by capturing non-linear relationships, achieving higher accuracy.
- Performance metrics (higher R-squared and lower RMSE and MAE) indicated better predictive accuracy compared to linear regression but tend to overfit if we are not careful with the data taken
- Variable importance analysis highlighted square_meters as the most influential predictor, validating its significant impact on property prices.

## Model Optimization:
- Both linear regression and Random Forest models were refined through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, ensuring robust predictions.
- Focused analysis on specific cantons and filtering data to a realistic price range further enhanced model performance and reduced overfitting.

## Recommendation
- For accurate property price predictions, a model tailored to specific cantons and price ranges is more effective, we try with different canton and the prediction was always better but we don't have enough space to show the 17 cantons :)
- Random Forest models, due to their ability to handle complex, non-linear interactions, are preferred over linear regression models for this task.

## Final Thoughts

This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting real estate prices, providing valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and academics. However, continuous model refinement and incorporation of more diverse data sources could further enhance predictive accuracy and reliability.
